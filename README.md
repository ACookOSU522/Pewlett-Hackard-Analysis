## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
As the "Silver Tsunami" wave begins there will be approx. 70,000 positions open for hiring and training. Recommendation for HR to work with department heads to create outlines for ideal candidate skill-set for interviewing/hiring.
Ample staff on hand now for immediate uptraining to fill the positions as retirements hit.
Any employee interested in a change in positions, with appropriate credentials, may inquire with their manager/department head.
